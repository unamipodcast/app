# Firebase Admin SDK Diagnostic Report

## Current Status

- **Firebase Admin SDK Connection**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
  - Auth: Working (1 user found)
  - Firestore: Working (collections: activities, children, resources, users)
  - Test Operations: Working (create, read, delete)

- **CLI Scripts**: ✅ WORKING
  - `create:admin-user`: Successfully updated existing admin user
  - `create:test-child`: Successfully created a test child profile

- **Web Application**: ❌ NOT WORKING
  - Admin users cannot create new users via the UI
  - Parent users cannot create child profiles via the UI

## API Endpoints Testing

| Endpoint | Method | Direct Script | Web UI |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------|
| `/api/admin-sdk/users` | POST | ✅ Working | ❌ Not Working |
| `/api/admin-sdk/users` | GET | ✅ Working | ❌ Not Working |
| `/api/admin-sdk/children` | POST | ✅ Working | ❌ Not Working |
| `/api/admin-sdk/children` | GET | ✅ Working | ❌ Not Working |

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Session Authentication Issue**:
   - The API endpoints are working when called directly with scripts
   - The API endpoints are failing when called from the web UI
   - This suggests an issue with the session authentication in the web UI

2. **Role-Based Access Control**:
   - Users are being redirected to the correct dashboards based on their roles
   - However, the session may not be properly passing the role information to the API

3. **Client-Side Integration**:
   - The client-side hooks may not be properly sending the authentication headers
   - The NextAuth session may not be properly integrated with the API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate Client-Side Hooks**:
   - Check `useAdminSdk.ts` hook implementation
   - Verify that authentication headers are being sent with API requests

2. **Debug Session Flow**:
   - Add logging to track session information throughout the request flow
   - Verify that the session contains the correct user ID and role information

3. **Test API Endpoints Directly**:
   - Use browser developer tools to make direct API calls
   - Compare request headers and payloads between working scripts and failing UI

4. **Fix Client-Side Integration**:
   - Update client-side hooks to properly send authentication information
   - Ensure NextAuth session is properly integrated with API calls

## Immediate Action Items

1. Add detailed logging to client-side hooks
2. Add detailed logging to API endpoints to track session information
3. Test API endpoints directly from the browser
4. Update client-side hooks to properly handle authentication

## Long-Term Recommendations

1. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
2. Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
3. Create automated tests for API endpoints and client-side hooks
4. Implement monitoring and alerting for API failures
