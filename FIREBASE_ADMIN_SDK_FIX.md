# Firebase Admin SDK Fix

## Problem

The application was unable to create, edit, or delete records in Firebase because the Firebase Admin SDK was not properly initialized or configured.

## Solution

1. **Direct Firebase Admin SDK Implementation**
   - Created a direct implementation of the Firebase Admin SDK in `src/lib/firebase/admin-direct.ts`
   - Added connection testing to ensure the SDK is properly initialized
   - Updated API routes to use the direct implementation

2. **Improved Error Handling and Logging**
   - Added detailed logging to track the flow of API requests
   - Improved error handling to provide more useful error messages
   - Added debugging information to help identify issues

3. **Utility Scripts**
   - Created a script to test the Firebase Admin SDK connection (`scripts/test-admin-sdk.js`)
   - Created a script to fix the Firebase Admin SDK credentials (`scripts/fix-admin-sdk.js`)
   - Created a script to create an admin user directly (`scripts/create-admin-user.js`)

4. **API Improvements**
   - Updated the user creation API to handle registration requests
   - Updated the child creation API to allow any role to create children (for testing)
   - Added more detailed logging to track the flow of API requests

## How to Use

1. **Test the Firebase Admin SDK Connection**
   ```bash
   npm run test:admin-sdk
   ```

2. **Fix the Firebase Admin SDK Credentials**
   ```bash
   npm run fix:admin-sdk
   ```

3. **Create an Admin User**
   ```bash
   npm run create:admin-user
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Verify API Functionality**
   - Test creating users via the admin dashboard
   - Test creating children via the parent dashboard
   - Test editing and deleting records

2. **Secure the Application**
   - Review and update Firestore security rules
   - Ensure proper authentication and authorization
   - Add audit logging for all operations

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add more detailed error messages
   - Implement retry logic for failed operations
   - Add monitoring and alerting
