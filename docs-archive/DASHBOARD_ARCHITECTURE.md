# UNCIP-APP Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
The UNCIP-APP dashboard architecture follows a modular, role-based approach that provides a consistent user experience while displaying relevant information for each user type. The architecture is designed to be maintainable, scalable, and easy to extend with new features.

## Core Components

### 1. DashboardOverview
The main dashboard component that adapts to different user roles. It serves as the container for all dashboard sections and handles the overall layout and structure.

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview.tsx`

**Features:**
- Adapts content based on user role (parent, school, authority, community, admin)
- Provides consistent layout across all user types
- Combines stats, quick actions, and recent activity in one place

**Usage:**
```tsx
// Example usage in a dashboard page
import DashboardOverview from '@/components/dashboard/DashboardOverview';

export default function ParentDashboard() {
  return <DashboardOverview role="parent" />;
}
```

### 2. DashboardStats
Displays role-specific statistics and metrics relevant to the user's role.

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard/DashboardStats.tsx`

**Features:**
- Shows different metrics based on user role
- Integrates with data hooks (useChildProfiles, useAlerts)
- Provides loading states for data fetching

### 3. QuickActions
Provides role-specific quick action buttons for common tasks.

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays different actions based on user role
- Consistent UI with customizable icons and colors
- Links to the appropriate pages for each role

### 4. RecentActivity
Shows user activity history and recent events.

**File:** `/src/components/dashboard/RecentActivity.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays recent user activities and system events
- Filters activities based on user role and permissions
- Includes loading states and empty state handling

## Role-Specific Dashboard Pages

Each user role has its own dashboard page that uses the shared components:

1. **Parent Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/parent/page.tsx`)
   - Child management
   - Alert reporting
   - Profile updates

2. **School Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/school/page.tsx`)
   - Student management
   - Attendance tracking
   - Incident reporting

3. **Authority Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/authority/page.tsx`)
   - Alert monitoring
   - Search functionality
   - Report generation

4. **Community Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/community/page.tsx`)
   - Community alerts
   - Resource management
   - Safety metrics

5. **Admin Dashboard** (`/src/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`)
   - User management
   - System monitoring
   - Configuration settings
   - Role switching functionality

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication & User Context**
   - The `useAuth` hook provides user information and role
   - Dashboard components adapt based on the user's role

2. **Data Fetching**
   - Custom hooks like `useChildProfiles` and `useAlerts` fetch data
   - Components display loading states during data fetching
   - Error handling is implemented at the hook level

3. **Component Hierarchy**
   ```
   DashboardLayout (from layout.tsx)
   └── Role-specific Dashboard Page
       └── DashboardOverview
           ├── DashboardStats
           ├── QuickActions
           └── RecentActivity
   ```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Data Visualization**
   - Add charts and graphs for statistical data
   - Implement interactive visualizations for metrics

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - Implement Firebase listeners for real-time data
   - Add notifications for important events

3. **Customization**
   - Allow users to customize their dashboard layout
   - Implement widget system for modular dashboard components

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Add filtering and sorting options for data
   - Implement search functionality across dashboard components

## Best Practices

1. **Component Reusability**
   - Use shared components with role-specific parameters
   - Avoid duplicating code across different dashboard pages

2. **Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript interfaces for component props
   - Define clear types for all data structures

3. **Performance**
   - Implement code splitting for dashboard components
   - Optimize data fetching with pagination and caching

4. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all dashboard components are accessible
   - Follow WCAG guidelines for UI elements
