## Remaining Tasks

The following items from the checklist still need to be addressed:

1. **Firebase Project Setup**
   - Create production Firebase project
   - Generate and secure Firebase Admin SDK credentials
   - Set up Firebase Functions if needed

2. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive testing suite
   - Perform security and performance testing
   - Test on various browsers and devices

3. **Documentation**
   - Create user and admin documentation
   - Document API endpoints
   - Create deployment process documentation

4. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
   - Configure Firebase Analytics
   - Implement performance monitoring

5. **Legal & Compliance**
   - Create privacy policy and terms of service
   - Ensure POPIA compliance (South African data protection)
   - Verify accessibility compliance

## Files Created or Modified

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - `/workspaces/app/.env.production`

2. **Security Implementation**
   - `/workspaces/app/src/lib/firebase/firestore-rules.txt`
   - `/workspaces/app/src/lib/firebase/storage-rules.txt`
