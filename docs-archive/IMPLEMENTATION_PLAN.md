# UNCIP-APP: Implementation Plan

Based on the review of the current codebase, this implementation plan outlines the steps needed to make the application fully functional.

## 1. Firebase Integration (Priority: High)

### Issues:
- Client-side hooks use API routes while API routes use Firebase Admin SDK
- useFirestore hook is incomplete and not properly used
- Real-time updates are missing for critical features

### Implementation:
1. ✅ Update useFirestore hook to be more flexible and support real-time subscriptions
2. ✅ Modify useChildProfiles and useAlerts hooks to use Firestore directly
3. ✅ Implement proper Firebase security rules for Firestore and Storage
4. ✅ Create useStorage hook for file uploads
5. ✅ Create useNotifications hook for real-time notifications
6. Update components to use the improved hooks

## 2. Error Handling (Priority: High)

### Issues:
- Error handling is inconsistent across the application
- No standardized error responses
- Missing error boundaries for UI components

### Implementation:
1. ✅ Create ErrorBoundary component
2. ✅ Implement standardized error handling utilities
3. ✅ Add form validation with Zod
4. Wrap critical components with ErrorBoundary
5. Update API routes with consistent error responses

## 3. Core Features Completion (Priority: Medium)

### Issues:
- Child profile management is incomplete
- Alert system lacks real-time updates
- Missing community features

### Implementation:
1. Complete child profile management
   - Implement photo upload with image cropping
   - Add document upload for identification
   - Implement validation for all fields
2. Enhance alert system
   - Complete alert creation workflow
   - Add notification system for new alerts
   - Implement geolocation features
3. Implement community features
   - Create community resources section
   - Implement incident reporting

## 4. Testing (Priority: Medium)

### Issues:
- No testing infrastructure
- Critical features lack tests

### Implementation:
1. Set up Jest with React Testing Library
2. Create test fixtures and mocks for Firebase
3. Write tests for critical components
4. Add API route tests

## 5. Performance Optimization (Priority: Low)

### Issues:
- No pagination for large data sets
- Missing caching strategy

### Implementation:
1. Add pagination for lists of children and alerts
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Optimize Firebase queries
4. Add loading states and skeleton loaders

## Next Steps

1. Complete the implementation of the improved hooks in all components
2. Add comprehensive error handling throughout the application
3. Implement the remaining core features
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Optimize performance for large data sets
