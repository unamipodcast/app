# Action Plan for Firebase Admin SDK Integration

## Problem Summary
The Firebase Admin SDK is working correctly when accessed directly via scripts, but not working when accessed through the web UI. Admin users cannot create new users, and parent users cannot create child profiles through the UI.

## Diagnostic Steps Completed
1. Verified Firebase Admin SDK connection is working
2. Confirmed CLI scripts can successfully create users and children
3. Identified that the issue is likely in the client-side integration

## Action Plan for Tomorrow

### 1. Debug Client-Side Hooks (30 min)
- Examine `useAdminSdk.ts` hook implementation
- Add detailed logging to track request/response flow
- Check if authentication headers are being properly sent

### 2. Analyze API Request Flow (30 min)
- Use browser developer tools to capture API requests
- Compare request headers between working scripts and failing UI calls
- Verify CSRF token handling and session cookies

### 3. Fix Session Authentication (1 hour)
- Update API routes to properly handle session authentication
- Ensure NextAuth session is correctly passed to API endpoints
- Fix any CORS or cookie issues that might be blocking requests

### 4. Update Client-Side Integration (1 hour)
- Modify client hooks to properly send authentication information
- Update form submission handlers to include necessary headers
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### 5. Test User Creation Flow (30 min)
- Test admin user creating a new user through the UI
- Verify the user is created in both Firebase Auth and Firestore
- Confirm custom claims are properly set

### 6. Test Child Creation Flow (30 min)
- Test parent user creating a child profile through the UI
- Verify the child profile is created in Firestore
- Confirm proper guardian relationships are established

### 7. Implement Monitoring (30 min)
- Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Create error tracking for API failures
- Implement user feedback for successful/failed operations

## Expected Outcomes
1. Admin users can successfully create new users through the UI
2. Parent users can successfully create child profiles through the UI
3. All operations are properly logged and monitored
4. Users receive appropriate feedback for their actions

## Fallback Plan
If the client-side integration cannot be fixed quickly:
1. Create a temporary admin page that directly calls the scripts
2. Implement a simplified child creation form that uses direct API calls
3. Document the workaround for users until the full solution is implemented
